                        Lean manufacturing principles focus on identifying and eliminating activities that do not contribute value to end products or production processes, encompassing operational improvements at the shop floor level. Originating in post-World War II Japan, Taiichi Ohno's framework of Muda, Muri, and Mura underpinned Toyota's production strategy, emphasizing waste reduction, impossibility minimization, and unevenness compensation respectively. Shah and Ward (2007) determined ten key factors to enhance lean manufacturing practices, including supplier feedback, just-in-time delivery, and employee involvement. Sanders et al. (2016) categorized these factors into four dimensions: supplier, customer, process, and control. Supplier factors focus on supplier integration, customer factors emphasize customer involvement, process factors address operational efficiency, and control factors encompass system management and employee engagement. This structured approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding and implementation of lean manufacturing principles.

                        Applying lean manufacturing principles offers several benefits to organizations. By identifying and eliminating non-value-adding activities, companies can streamline their production processes, reduce waste, and enhance overall efficiency. This leads to cost savings through the optimization of resources and improved productivity. Additionally, lean practices promote higher product quality by minimizing defects and errors, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, lean manufacturing principles foster a culture of continuous improvement and employee empowerment, as employees are encouraged to contribute ideas for process enhancement and are provided with the necessary tools and training to do so. Overall, the adoption of lean manufacturing principles enables organizations to achieve sustainable growth, remain competitive in the market, and adapt to changing customer demands more effectively.
