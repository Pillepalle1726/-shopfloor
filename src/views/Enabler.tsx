                        However, to fully leverage the benefits of digital technologies, it is essential for companies to ensure compatibility with lean principles. This requires organizing operations in a lean manner before integrating digital innovations to avoid automating inefficiencies. Simplifying processes before digitizing them helps companies to maximize the effectiveness of both lean practices and digital technologies. Additionally, careful selection of digital technologies that align with lean manufacturing principles is crucial for generating added value and achieving harmony between the two. Ultimately, achieving synergy between lean practices and digital technologies is essential for improving production processes and ensuring sustainable efficiency gains.
