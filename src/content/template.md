# Overview of Order Progress
The lack of real-time visibility into order status and progress impedes effective planning and resource allocation. In this scenario, affected parties have the problem that outdated or incomplete order information can lead to inaccurate production planning. This can result in overproduction, underutilization of resources, or missed delivery deadlines. Without visibility, allocating resources becomes a dangerous game and inefficiencies can lead to increased costs and delays. Late deliveries due to poor order tracking can then frustrate customers and harm business reputation. In addition to that, lack of real-time data affects inventory management, where excess inventory ties up capital, while insufficient stock disrupts production.
