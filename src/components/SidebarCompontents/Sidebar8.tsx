            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
                Slow improvement cycles delay adaptation to changing requirements and hinder agility. Shortening improvement cycles allows organizations to respond fast to changing requirements, market dynamics, and technological advancements. This fosters a culture of continuous innovation, resulting in cost savings due to streamlined processes and reduced time-to-market. Shorter cycles allow proactive risk management and help to allocate resources more effectively.
