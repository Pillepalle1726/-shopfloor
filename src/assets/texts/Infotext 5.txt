Problem: Difficult Employee Enablement – Availability of Skilled Workers: 
The scarcity of skilled workers and inadequate training hinder workforce effectiveness.

Skilled workers contribute directly to product quality. Their expertise ensures that each item produced meets or exceeds specifications. Thus, overcoming scarcity ensures that quality standards are consistently upheld, preventing defects and customer dissatisfaction. Moreover, the availability of skilled workers leads to fewer disruptions, as skilled employees can troubleshoot effectively. Timely interventions prevent prolonged downtime, ensuring continuous production flow and efficient shop floor operations leading to cost savings, reduced errors, less rework, and optimized processes. This means that skilled workers contribute to higher output per labor hour, ultimately boosting profitability.

Better comparability of employees and simplified access to knowledge are essential for this. This is mainly driven by the following technologies:

1.MES System
Transparency about the output and strengths/weaknesses of employees. 
2.SCADA System
Possibility to digitalise and record processes to facilitate training. 
3.Big Data Analytics
Given data can be structured to be analysed. This enables conclusions to be drawn.

Relevant Lean Manufacturing principles are:
1.Process Factors 
Consisting of pull production, continuous flow, and setup time reduction. 
2.Control and Human Factors 
Consisting of TPM, statistical process control, and employee participation. 
3.Supplier Factors 
Consisting of supplier feedback, supplier development, and just-in-time delivery. 
4.Customer Factors 
Comprising customer involvement.
