Problem: Limited Transparency of Process Performance (Downtime, OEE, etc.): 
Insufficient insights into downtime, OEE, and other performance metrics hinder process optimization.

Real-time process visualization equips managers and operators with a comprehensive view of the shop floor. By monitoring workstations and tracking material flow, they gain timely insights. Real-time insights allow identification of specific downtime events (e.g., equipment breakdowns, maintenance, changeovers). This means that decisions can be made more quickly, which helps to optimize processes, by fine-tuning cycle times, reducing delays and enhancing throughput. Moreover, detecting deviations early prevents defective units from progressing downstream.

To this end, the focus is on automating manual work processes in order to obtain process data that can be utilised and interpreted. This can be achieved by the following technologies:

1.SCADA System
Process irregularities can be reduced  leading to less downtimes of machines
2.Cloud Computing
IT infrastructure is better accessible and transparent through cloud technology
3.IoT 
More insights through more transparency and connected software and tools
4.Sensors and Actuators
Improved insights through more and reliable data points
