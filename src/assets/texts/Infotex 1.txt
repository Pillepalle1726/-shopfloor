Problem: Lack of real-time visibility of order status for effective resource allocation.
The lack of real-time visibility into your order status and progresses disturbs effective planning and resource allocation and causes costly wastes

By ensuring accurate and up-to-date order data, production planning becomes more precise. This leads to optimized resource utilization, reduced waste, and timely deliveries. In addition, improved visibility allows for smarter allocation of resources. As a result, costs decrease, and production processes become more streamlined. Effective order tracking ensures on-time deliveries, enhancing customer satisfaction and bolstering the companyâ€™s reputation. Moreover, real-time data enables better inventory control. Excess stock is minimized, freeing up capital, while maintaining sufficient stock levels ensures uninterrupted production.

The main focus therefore is on traceability and data visualization. Important therefore is that data can be collected from different sources and feedback can be utilized from them. Three key technologies are at the center of this:

1.ERP System
Visualization of Data from an enterprise perspective.
2.SCADA System
Centralized supervisory and control lead to less costs for monitoring.
3.Track & Trace Technologies
Better planning through more data points.

Relevant Lean Manufacturing principles are:
1.Process factors
Consisting of pull production, continuous flow, and setup time reduction. 

2.Control and human factors 
Consisting of TPM, statistical process control, and employee participation.
