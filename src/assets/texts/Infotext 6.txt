Problem:  Merging of tacit knowledge from workers and data from systems/processes.
Failing to connect tacit knowledge with data worsen decision-making challenges.

By combining practical insights form experienced employees with context-specific data-driven insights, decision-makers gain a comprehensive understanding. This integration enables quicker identification of for example bottlenecks and inefficiencies, allowing workers to streamline operations, boost productivity, and minimize downtime. Moreover, incorporating tacit knowledge like best practices into data ensures an easier knowledge sharing among employees, accelerating their involvement. 

Therefore it is important to excel the involvement of employees and the simultaneous integration and utilisation of knowledge. Suitable Technologies therefore are: 

1.SCADA System
The evaluation and visualization of knowledge facilitates knowledge triangulation.  
2.Big Data Analytics
Given data can be structured to be analyzed and compared. This enables conclusions to be drawn.
