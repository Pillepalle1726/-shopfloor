Problem: Difficulty in capturing errors by humans or machines systematically 
Disrupted improvement cycles delay adaptation to changing requirements and hinder agility on shop floor level.

By identifying the underlying causes of errors, companies can address the fundamental issues rather than merely treating symptoms. This leads to more robust and lasting solutions. When error conditions are systematically captured, organizations can take targeted corrective actions, which may involve process improvements, training, equipment maintenance, or other adaptive actions. By analyzing patterns and trends, organizations can implement preventive measures.  It enables organizations to learn from mistakes, refine processes, and enhance product reliability. Moreover, data on error conditions facilitates decision-making. Thus, managers can allocate resources, prioritize tasks, and allocate budgets based on facts and figures and adapt faster to changing environments.

Therefore, better monitoring options are needed paired with a simplified way of recording errors. This can be achieved by the following technologies, among others:

1.ERP System
Visualization of Data from for transparent decision making
2.MES System
Less documentation through increased transparency of information
3.SCADA System
Centralized supervisory and control leads to less costs for monitoring
4.Mobile Computing
Simplified recording of occurrences during the manufacturing process
5.Sensors and Actuators
Better planning through more data points
6.Wearables
Increased overview through better access to information
