Problem: Long improvement cycles for improvement and innovation within the company.
Slow improvement cycles delay adaptation to changing requirements and hinder agility.

Shortening improvement cycles allows organizations to respond fast to changing requirements, market dynamics, and technological advancements. Moreover it fosters a culture of continuous innovation, resulting in cost savings due to streamlined processes and reduced time-to-market. Shorter cycles allow proactive risk management and help to allocate resources more effectively.

Two things are essential for this. Firstly, employees must be motivated and open to change and secondly, a "fail fast" culture must be introduced and practised. Technologies that make this possible are:

1.Big Data Analytics
Insights can be gained from data more quickly and recommendations for action can be derived from them.
2.IoT 
Interconnectivity enables the interaction of various data-generating activities.
3.Wearables
New, relevant technologies motivate employees to use them and get more involved.

Relevant Lean Manufacturing principles are:
1.Process Factors 
Consisting of pull production, continuous flow, and setup time reduction. 
2.Control and Human Factors 
Consisting of TPM, statistical process control, and employee participation. 
3.Supplier Factors 
Consisting of supplier feedback, supplier development, and just-in-time delivery.
