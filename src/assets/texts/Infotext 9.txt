Problem: Limited management access to the shop floor to realize opportunities and challenges.
The difficulty of recognizing challenges and realising opportunities, which are defined by new issues relating to resource efficiency, innovation, compliance and sustainability, caused by limited access of the management to the shop floor.

When leaders engage more with the shop floor, they gain insights into challenges in various relevant and recent topics. Understanding them enables leaders to allocate resources more effectively. Moreover, this engagement with onsite teams can facilitate an easier recognition of emerging opportunities and increases the engagement of employees to contribute ideas, leading to continuous improvement, too. 

This requires communication and collaboration, which is made possible by breaking down invisible communication barriers between company levels. Technologies that support this are:

1.SCADA System

2.Big Data Analytics
