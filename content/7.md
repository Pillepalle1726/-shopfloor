# Problem: No Data-Based Process Optimization or the Possibility to Learn from Data

Absence of data-driven insights limits continuous improvement efforts.

Implementing data-driven process optimization allows organizations to identify bottlenecks, streamline workflows, and reduce waste. These insights provide a factual basis for decision-making, facilitating optimization. Regular analysis of data encourages employees to seek innovative solutions and refine processes for continuous improvement. This enables organizations to proactively address potential issues, reducing operational and financial risks.

The generation of data and the quality of this data are at main focus. Advantageous technologies for this are:

1. **Big Data Analytics**
   - Patterns and information can be retrieved, increasing the quality and usability of given data.
2. **SCADA System**
   - Data can be visualized and conclusions drawn.
3. **Cloud Computing**
   - Increases the availability and usability of generated data.
4. **IoT**
   - Increases cross-linking at shop floor level, which expands the amount of usable data points.
5. **Sensors and Actuators**
   - Increases the overall amount of data points.
