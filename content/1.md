# Problem: Lack of Real-Time Visibility of Order Status for Effective Resource Allocation

The lack of real-time visibility into order status and progress disrupts effective planning and resource allocation, causing costly wastes.

By ensuring accurate and up-to-date order data, production planning becomes more precise. This leads to optimized resource utilization, reduced waste, and timely deliveries. Improved visibility allows for smarter allocation of resources, decreasing costs and streamlining production processes. Effective order tracking ensures on-time deliveries, enhancing customer satisfaction and bolstering the company’s reputation. Moreover, real-time data enables better inventory control. Excess stock is minimized, freeing up capital, while maintaining sufficient stock levels ensures uninterrupted production.

The main focus is therefore on traceability and data visualization. It is crucial that data can be collected from different sources and feedback can be utilized from them. Three key technologies are at the center of this:

1. **ERP System**
   - Visualization of Data from an enterprise perspective
2. **SCADA System**
   - Centralized supervisory and control lead to less costs for monitoring
3. **Track & Trace Technologies**
   - Better planning through more data points
