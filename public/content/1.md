# Improving Real-Time Visibility of Order Status

## Problem: Lack of Real-Time Visibility of Order Status for Effective Resource Allocation

The lack of real-time visibility into your order status and progress disturbs effective planning and resource allocation, leading to costly wastes.

By ensuring accurate and up-to-date order data, production planning becomes more precise. This leads to optimized resource utilization, reduced waste, and timely deliveries. Improved visibility allows for smarter allocation of resources. As a result, costs decrease, and production processes become more streamlined. Effective order tracking ensures on-time deliveries, enhancing customer satisfaction and bolstering the companyâ€™s reputation. Moreover, real-time data enables better inventory control. Excess stock is minimized, freeing up capital, while maintaining sufficient stock levels ensures uninterrupted production.

## Focus on Traceability and Data Visualization

To address these issues, focus on traceability and data visualization. It is crucial to collect data from various sources and utilize feedback. Three key technologies are at the center of this approach:

1. **ERP System**  
   Visualization of data from an enterprise perspective.

2. **SCADA System**  
   Centralized supervisory and control lead to lower monitoring costs.

3. **Track & Trace Technologies**  
   Better planning through more data points.

## Relevant Lean Manufacturing Principles

Relevant Lean Manufacturing principles to consider include:

1. **Process Factors**  
   Consisting of pull production, continuous flow, and setup time reduction.

2. **Control and Human Factors**  
   Consisting of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), statistical process control, and employee participation.
