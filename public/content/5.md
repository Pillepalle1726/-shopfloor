# Improving Employee Enablement and Availability of Skilled Workers

## Problem: Difficult Employee Enablement – Availability of Skilled Workers

The scarcity of skilled workers and inadequate training hinder workforce effectiveness.

Skilled workers contribute directly to product quality. Their expertise ensures that each item produced meets or exceeds specifications. Overcoming scarcity ensures that quality standards are consistently upheld, preventing defects and customer dissatisfaction. Moreover, the availability of skilled workers leads to fewer disruptions, as skilled employees can troubleshoot effectively. Timely interventions prevent prolonged downtime, ensuring continuous production flow and efficient shop floor operations. This leads to cost savings, reduced errors, less rework, and optimized processes. Skilled workers contribute to higher output per labor hour, ultimately boosting profitability.

Better comparability of employees and simplified access to knowledge are essential for this. This is mainly driven by the following technologies:

1. **MES System**  
   Transparency about the output and strengths/weaknesses of employees.

2. **SCADA System**  
   Possibility to digitize and record processes to facilitate training.

3. **Big Data Analytics**  
   Given data can be structured to be analyzed, enabling conclusions to be drawn.

## Relevant Lean Manufacturing Principles

Relevant Lean Manufacturing principles to consider include:

1. **Process Factors**  
   Consisting of pull production, continuous flow, and setup time reduction.

2. **Control and Human Factors**  
   Consisting of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), statistical process control, and employee participation.

3. **Supplier Factors**  
   Consisting of supplier feedback, supplier development, and just-in-time delivery.

4. **Customer Factors**
